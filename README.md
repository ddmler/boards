# Boards

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ddmler/boards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ddmler/boards)

A small Trello clone built as a Vue single page application with a Laravel API as the backend. It features different boards, lists and cards that can be reordered arbitrarily and continuous deployment with TravisCI to heroku. The Vue components are tested with Jest, the API with PHPUnit. 

Live demo available on: [Heroku](https://ddmler-boards.herokuapp.com/) (you have to wait a moment while the vm boots up)
